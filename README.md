# ðŸ›  Workshop: REST API Testing
## Workshop Overview
This is a summary of a two-week school workshop focusing on testing a REST API for the "MataffÃ¤ren" application. During this workshop, we used Postman and Newman for API testing, automating checks for various functionalities within the applicationâ€™s REST API. The first week focused on creating and executing Postman test collections, while the second week expanded to using Cucumber and JavaScriptâ€™s built-in fetch command to test the same API endpoints.

### Workshop Objectives:
The primary objectives of this workshop were to:

1. **Analyze the MataffÃ¤ren REST API** by examining endpoints and their expected responses to understand the application's data flow and structure.
2. **Conduct manual API testing in Postman** to recreate and verify API behavior as seen in the MataffÃ¤ren frontend.
3. **Develop automated Postman tests** to validate API endpoints for retrieving categories, products, and implementing sorting features.
4. **Integrate Postman tests with Newman** to enable CLI-based testing and automate these checks through GitHub Actions.
5. **Replicate API tests with Cucumber and fetch in JavaScript**, creating BDD-based test scenarios for the same API functions and integrating these tests into a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.


### Workshop Achievements
#### Testing Coverage
- **Postman/Newman:** Comprehensive test coverage was achieved for critical API functions:

- Fetching product lists for all main categories, subcategories, and sub-subcategories.
- Validating pagination logic, including page size and current page in responses.
- Ensuring response structure integrity, such as the presence and data types of required fields (e.g., name, price, comparePrice, and image).
- Verifying sorting functionality for all seven sorting options in every main category.
- Despite covering main categories extensively, subcategories and sub-subcategories testing was limited due to resource constraints. These tests, however, are extendable for full coverage.

- **Cucumber and fetch:** Tested the same critical API functions as in Postman/Newman, but with the following limitations:

- Fetching product lists was limited to main and all categories; subcategories and sub-subcategories were not tested.
- Pagination was not fully dynamic: this tests do not dynamically iterate through all pages or cover every category in the API. 
- Validated response structure for required fields (e.g., name, price, comparePrice, and image) but not across all products or pages in each category.
- Verified sorting functionality for all seven sorting options in main categories but only the first 100 products per category (API limit) 
- These tests maintained coverage of key functionalities but were less exhaustive due to dynamic limitations.

 **Cucumber and fetch part** are located in the branch **[endpoint-testning-cucumber-chai]**(https://github.com/YevShch/Workshop-REST-API-testing/tree/endpoint-testning-cucumber-chai-fetch)


  #### Challenges and Solutions
1. **Handling missing or incomplete data**

- Products without a comparePrice field were skipped in comparison tests to prevent errors.
- Products missing image fields failed validation but were excluded from critical workflows to proceed with testing.

2. **Integration with GitHub Actions**

Newman tests faced connection issues with third-level categories in CI workflows. Splitting the tests into smaller collections and parallel jobs improved stability but did not fully resolve the problem. Tests ran successfully locally, indicating CI-specific resource constraints.

3. **Sorting by price and comparePrice**

Addressed challenges in sorting logic by dynamically selecting *price* or *comparePrice* from either *potentialPromotions* or default fields.
