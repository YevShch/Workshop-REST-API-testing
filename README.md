# ðŸ›  Workshop: REST API Testing
## Workshop Overview
This is a summary of a two-week school workshop focusing on testing a REST API for the "MataffÃ¤ren" application. During this workshop, we used Postman and Newman for API testing, automating checks for various functionalities within the applicationâ€™s REST API. The first week focused on creating and executing Postman test collections, while the second week expanded to using Cucumber and JavaScriptâ€™s built-in fetch command to test the same API endpoints.

### Workshop Objectives:
The primary objectives of this workshop were to:

1. **Analyze the MataffÃ¤ren REST API** by examining endpoints and their expected responses to understand the application's data flow and structure.
2. **Conduct manual API testing in Postman** to recreate and verify API behavior as seen in the MataffÃ¤ren frontend.
3. **Develop automated Postman tests** to validate API endpoints for retrieving categories, products, and implementing sorting features.
4. **Integrate Postman tests with Newman** to enable CLI-based testing and automate these checks through GitHub Actions.
5. **Replicate API tests with Cucumber and fetch in JavaScript**, creating BDD-based test scenarios for the same API functions and integrating these tests into a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
